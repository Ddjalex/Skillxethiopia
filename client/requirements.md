## Packages
framer-motion | Page transitions and detailed animations
lucide-react | Beautiful icons
react-player | For handling video playback (Vimeo/YouTube wrappers)

## Notes
The backend uses session-based auth, so `credentials: "include"` is required for all fetch requests.
Video playback will use `react-player` to handle the `videoRef` which might be a Vimeo URL.
Dark mode is default for this "cinema/learning" aesthetic.
